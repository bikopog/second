            Today I would like to tell you a story about <b>McSekani</b>:
            <p>He is very good boy, I like him so much...</p>
            <p>But, this guy is a scammer.</p>
            <p>He said that he is sick, and badly need money</p>
            <p>He presented himself as person who need money because his dad is dying</p>
            <p><b>I trusted him, and sent money</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>If you want to know, why I am writing to you about it.. it's because to be careful with person</p>
            <p>I want to <b>prevent</b> you from mistakes</p>
            <p>Maybe he was your student, friend your boyfriend that you trusted, I'm sorry for that</p>
            <p>But there is good news too. I have evidence of his guilt</p>
            <p>So, very soon <b>JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL</b></p>
